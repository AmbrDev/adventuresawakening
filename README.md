## 0.5.3
#### Adventures Awakening 0.5.3 will be fixing a few bugs and allowing better security. There will be a chat function to chat with your friends. Chat will only be functionable on the LATEST VERSION. We are working on any and all grammar mistakes, if you see one, report it!

#### Music engine is still currently being built. Many of the developers are still working on it, there will be basic music.

#### If you want to make a Mod for our game do #AdventuresAwakeningModification in your repository description. It will be reviewed for release. Fork the repository and add your modifications in the main.ts area (unless you know what you are doing, you can edit any file.) All modifications will go to the repository in our orginization named "aa-mods".

#### Online multiplayer is being worked on as we speak. This is a feature that will be in a great release.

## Anti-piracy (of payed full version when it comes out)
#### Software piracy (the illegal copying of software programs) is a worldwide problem — more than $11 billion is lost to piracy every year. Because software is valuable, and it is easy to create an exact copy of a program from a single computer, software piracy is widespread.

#### The illegal copying of software programs is a crime! In the United States and many other countries, copyright law provides for severe civil and criminal penalties for the unauthorized reproduction or distribution of copyrighted material. Copyrighted material includes, but is not limited to, computer programs and accompanying sounds, images and text. Under U.S. law, infringement may result in civil damages of up to $150,000 and/or criminal penalties of up to five years imprisonment and/or a $250,000 fine.

#### Please join Tabletop in its piracy prevention efforts. You can report incidents of software piracy to the SIIA (see below section “Report Piracy to the SIIA.”) Also, you can help your business avoid serious problems with sound software asset management practices as explained in the section below.
